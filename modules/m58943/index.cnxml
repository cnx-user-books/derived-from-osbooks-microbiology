<para id="fs-id1167662603827">Fungal infections of the nervous system, called <term>neuromycoses</term>, are rare in healthy individuals. However, neuromycoses can be devastating in immunocompromised or elderly patients. Several eukaryotic parasites are also capable of infecting the nervous system of human hosts. Although relatively uncommon, these infections can also be life-threatening in immunocompromised individuals. In this section, we will first discuss neuromycoses, followed by parasitic infections of the nervous system.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167658029780"><term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Cryptococcus neoformans</emphasis></term> is a fungal pathogen that can cause meningitis.

Most <emphasis effect="italics">C. neoformans</emphasis> cases result in subclinical respiratory infections that, in healthy individuals, generally resolve spontaneously with no long-term consequences (see <link document="m58915">Respiratory Mycoses</link>). In immunocompromised patients or those with other underlying illnesses, the infection can progress to cause <term class="no-emphasis">meningitis</term> and granuloma formation in brain tissues. <emphasis effect="italics">Cryptococcus</emphasis> antigens can also serve to inhibit cell-mediated immunity and delayed-type hypersensitivity.</para>

<title>Amoebic Meningitis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660637584"><term>Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM)</term> is caused by <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Naegleria fowleri</emphasis></term>. This amoeboflagellate is commonly found free-living in soils and water. It can exist in one of three forms—the infective amoebic trophozoite form, a motile flagellate form, and a resting cyst form. PAM is a rare disease that has been associated with young and otherwise healthy individuals. Individuals are typically infected by the <term class="no-emphasis">amoeba</term> while swimming in warm bodies of freshwater such as rivers, lakes, and hot springs. The pathogenic trophozoite infects the brain by initially entering through nasal passages to the sinuses; it then moves down olfactory nerve fibers to penetrate the submucosal nervous plexus, invades the cribriform plate, and reaches the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space is highly vascularized and is a route of dissemination of trophozoites to other areas of the CNS, including the brain (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_26_04_Naegleria"/>). Inflammation and destruction of gray matter leads to severe headaches and fever. Within days, confusion and convulsions occur and quickly progress to seizures, coma, and death. The progression can be very rapid, and the disease is often not diagnosed until autopsy.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660351650"><emphasis effect="italics">N. fowleri</emphasis> infections can be confirmed by direct observation of CSF; the amoebae can often be seen moving while viewing a fresh <term class="no-emphasis">CSF</term> wet mount through a microscope. Flagellated forms can occasionally also be found in CSF. The amoebae can be stained with several stains for identification, including Giemsa-Wright or a modified trichrome stain. Detection of antigens with indirect immunofluorescence, or genetic analysis with PCR, can be used to confirm an initial diagnosis. <emphasis effect="italics">N. fowleri</emphasis> infections are nearly always fatal; only 3 of 138 patients with PAM in the United States have survived.<footnote id="fs-id1167662791403">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “<emphasis effect="italics">Naegleria fowleri</emphasis>—Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM)—Amebic Encephalitis,” 2016. Accessed June 30, 2016. http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/treatment.html.</footnote> A new experimental drug called <term class="no-emphasis">miltefosine</term> shows some promise for treating these infections. This drug is a phosphotidylcholine derivative that is thought to inhibit membrane function in <emphasis effect="italics">N. fowleri</emphasis>, triggering apoptosis and disturbance of lipid-dependent cell signaling pathways.<footnote id="fs-id1167662551778">Dorlo, Thomas PC, Manica Balasegaram, Jos H.

<title>Granulomatous Amoebic Encephalitis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660186595"><term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Acanthamoeba</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Balamuthia</emphasis></term> species are free-living amoebae found in many bodies of fresh water. Human infections by these amoebae are rare. However, they can cause <term class="no-emphasis">amoebic keratitis</term> in contact lens wearers (see <link document="m58910">Protozoan and Helminthic Infections of the Eyes</link>), disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients, and <term>granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE)</term> in severe cases. Compared to PAM, GAE tend to be subacute infections. The microbe is thought to enter through either the nasal sinuses or breaks in the skin. It is disseminated hematogenously and can invade the CNS. There, the infections lead to inflammation, formation of lesions, and development of typical neurological symptoms of encephalitis (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_26_04_AmoeEnceph"/>). GAE is nearly always fatal.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660302217">GAE is often not diagnosed until late in the infection. Lesions caused by the infection can be detected using CT or MRI. The live amoebae can be directly detected in CSF or tissue biopsies. Serological tests are available but generally are not necessary to make a correct diagnosis, since the presence of the organism in <term class="no-emphasis">CSF</term> is definitive. Some antifungal drugs, like <term class="no-emphasis">fluconazole</term>, have been used to treat acanthamoebal infections. In addition, a combination of <term class="no-emphasis">miltefosine</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">voriconazole</term> (an inhibitor of ergosterol biosynthesis) has recently been used to successfully treat GAE. Even with treatment, however, the mortality rate for patients with these infections is high.</para>

<title>Human African Trypanosomiasis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662498195"><term>Human African trypanosomiasis</term> (also known as <term>African sleeping sickness</term>) is a serious disease endemic to two distinct regions in sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by the insect-borne hemoflagellate <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Trypanosoma brucei</emphasis></term>. The subspecies <emphasis effect="italics">Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</emphasis> causes <term>East African trypanosomiasis</term> (EAT), and another subspecies, <emphasis effect="italics">Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</emphasis> causes <term>West African trypanosomiasis</term> (WAT). A few hundred cases of EAT are currently reported each year.<footnote id="fs-id1167660338446">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “Parasites – African Trypanosomiasis (also known as Sleeping Sickness), East African Trypanosomiasis FAQs,” 2012. Accessed June 30, 2016. http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/sleepingsickness/gen_info/faqs-east.html.</footnote> WAT is more commonly reported and tends to be a more chronic disease. Around 7000 to 10,000 new cases of WAT are identified each year.<footnote id="fs-id1167662518438">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “Parasites – African Trypanosomiasis (also known as Sleeping Sickness), Epidemiology &amp; Risk Factors,” 2012.

<para id="fs-id1167662647704"><emphasis effect="italics">T. brucei</emphasis> is primarily transmitted to humans by the bite of the <term class="no-emphasis">tsetse fly</term> (<emphasis effect="italics">Glossina</emphasis> spp.). Soon after the bite of a tsetse fly, a chancre forms at the site of infection. The flagellates then spread, moving into the circulatory system (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_26_04_Trypanosom"/>). These systemic infections result in an <term class="no-emphasis">undulating fever</term>, during which symptoms persist for two or three days with remissions of about a week between bouts. As the disease enters its final phase, the pathogens move from the lymphatics into the CNS. Neurological symptoms include daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and mental deterioration. In EAT, the disease runs its course over a span of weeks to months. In contrast, WAT often occurs over a span of months to years.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662650963">Although a strong immune response is mounted against the trypanosome, it is not sufficient to eliminate the pathogen. Through <term class="no-emphasis">antigenic variation</term>, <emphasis effect="italics">Trypanosoma</emphasis> can change their surface proteins into over 100 serological types. This variation leads to the undulating form of the initial disease. The initial septicemia caused by the infection leads to high fevers. As the immune system responds to the infection, the number of organisms decrease, and the clinical symptoms abate. However, a subpopulation of the pathogen then alters its surface coat antigens by antigenic variation and evades the immune response. These flagellates rapidly proliferate and cause another bout of disease. If untreated, these infections are usually fatal.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660378198">Clinical symptoms can be used to recognize the early signs of African trypanosomiasis. These include the formation of a chancre at the site of infection and <term>Winterbottom’s sign</term>. Winterbottom’s sign refers to the enlargement of lymph nodes on the back of the neck—often indicative of cerebral infections. <emphasis effect="italics">Trypanosoma</emphasis> can be directly observed in stained samples including blood, lymph, CSF, and skin biopsies of chancres from patients. Antibodies against the parasite are found in most patients with acute or chronic disease. Serologic testing is generally not used for diagnosis, however, since the microscopic detection of the parasite is sufficient. Early diagnosis is important for treatment. Before the nervous system is involved, drugs like <term class="no-emphasis">pentamidine</term> (an inhibitor of nuclear metabolism) and <term class="no-emphasis">suramin</term> (mechanism unclear) can be used. These drugs have fewer side effects than the drugs needed to treat the second stage of the disease. Once the sleeping sickness phase has begun, harsher drugs including <term class="no-emphasis">melarsoprol</term> (an arsenic derivative) and <term class="no-emphasis">eflornithine</term> can be effective. Following successful treatment, patients still need to have follow-up examinations of their CSF for two years to detect possible relapses of the disease. The most effective means of preventing these diseases is to control the insect vector populations.</para>
