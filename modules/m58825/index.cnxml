<para id="fs-id1167658064098">Energy flows directionally through ecosystems, entering as sunlight for <term class="no-emphasis">phototroph</term>s or as inorganic molecules for <term class="no-emphasis">chemoautotroph</term>s. The six most common elements associated with organic molecules—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—take a variety of chemical forms and may exist for long periods in the atmosphere, on land, in water, or beneath earth’s surface. Geologic processes, such as erosion, water drainage, the movement of the continental plates, and weathering, all are involved in the cycling of elements on earth. Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process, the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their nonliving environment is called a <term>biogeochemical cycle</term>. Here, we will focus on the function of microorganisms in these cycles, which play roles at each step, most frequently interconverting oxidized versions of molecules with reduced ones.</para>
<section id="fs-id1167662482638">
<title>Carbon Cycle</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660190656">Carbon is one of the most important elements to living organisms, as shown by its abundance and presence in all organic molecules. The <term class="no-emphasis">carbon cycle</term> exemplifies the connection between organisms in various ecosystems. Carbon is exchanged between <term class="no-emphasis">heterotroph</term>s and <term class="no-emphasis">autotroph</term>s within and between ecosystems primarily by way of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, a fully oxidized version of carbon that serves as the basic building block that autotrophs use to build multicarbon, high-energy organic molecules such as glucose. Photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs harness energy from the sun and from inorganic chemical compounds, respectively, to covalently bond carbon atoms together into reduced organic compounds whose energy can be later accessed through the processes of <term class="no-emphasis">respiration</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">fermentation</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_08_07_CCycle"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662727931">Overall, there is a constant exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> between the heterotrophs (which produce CO<sub>2</sub> as a result of respiration or fermentation) and the autotrophs (which use the CO<sub>2</sub> for fixation). Autotrophs also respire or ferment, consuming the organic molecules they form; they do not fix carbon for heterotrophs, but rather use it for their own metabolic needs.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662599388">Bacteria and archaea that use methane as their carbon source are called <term class="no-emphasis">methanotroph</term>s. Reduced one-carbon compounds like methane accumulate in certain anaerobic environments when CO<sub>2</sub> is used as a terminal electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration by archaea called <term class="no-emphasis">methanogen</term>s. Some methanogens also ferment acetate (two carbons) to produce methane and CO<sub>2</sub>. Methane accumulation due to <term class="no-emphasis">methanogenesis</term> occurs in both natural anaerobic soil and aquatic environments; methane accumulation also occurs as a result of animal husbandry because methanogens are members of the normal microbiota of ruminants. Environmental methane accumulation due to methanogenesis is of consequence because it is a strong greenhouse gas, and methanotrophs help to reduce atmospheric methane levels.</para>

<title>Nitrogen Cycle</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660339337">Many biological macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, contain nitrogen; however, getting nitrogen into living organisms is difficult. Prokaryotes play essential roles in the <term class="no-emphasis">nitrogen cycle</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_08_07_NCycle"/>), transforming nitrogen between various forms for their own needs, benefiting other organisms indirectly. Plants and <term class="no-emphasis">phytoplankton</term> cannot incorporate nitrogen from the atmosphere (where it exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent N<sub>2</sub>), even though this molecule composes approximately 78% of the atmosphere. Nitrogen enters the living world through free-living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate nitrogen into their macromolecules through specialized biochemical pathways called <term>nitrogen fixation</term>. Cyanobacteria in aquatic ecosystems fix inorganic nitrogen (from nitrogen gas) into ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) that can be easily incorporated into biological macromolecules. <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Rhizobium</emphasis></term> bacteria (<link document="m58818" target-id="OSC_Microbio_08_00_Splash"/>) also fix nitrogen and live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as beans, peanuts, and peas), providing them with needed organic nitrogen while receiving fixed carbon as sugar in exchange. Free-living bacteria, such as members of the genus <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Azotobacter</emphasis></term>, are also able to fix nitrogen.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662506747">The nitrogen that enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is eventually converted from organic nitrogen back into nitrogen gas by microbes through three steps: ammonification, <term class="no-emphasis">nitrification</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis">denitrification</term>. In terrestrial systems, the first step is the <term class="no-emphasis">ammonification</term> process, in which certain bacteria and fungi convert nitrogenous waste from living animals or from the remains of dead organisms into ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>).

Last, the process of denitrification occurs, whereby soil bacteria, such as members of the genera <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Pseudomonas</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Clostridium</emphasis></term>, use nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor in <term class="no-emphasis">anaerobic respiration</term>, converting it into nitrogen gas that reenters the atmosphere. A similar process occurs in the marine nitrogen cycle, where these three processes are performed by marine bacteria and archaea.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662374743">Human activity releases nitrogen into the environment by the use of artificial fertilizers that contain nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, which are then washed into lakes, rivers, and streams by surface runoff. A major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater <term class="no-emphasis">eutrophication</term>, in which nutrient runoff causes the overgrowth and subsequent death of aquatic algae, making water sources anaerobic and inhospitable for the survival of aquatic organisms.</para>

Both of these can end up in waterways causing eutrophication. Nitrates can be taken in by plants or converted to gaseous nitrate (N2) by denitrification.">

<title>Sulfur Cycle</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660256570">Sulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living organisms. As part of the amino acids cysteine and methionine, it is involved in the formation of proteins. It is also found in several vitamins necessary for the synthesis of important biological molecules like <term class="no-emphasis">coenzyme A</term>. Several groups of microbes are responsible for carrying out processes involved in the <term class="no-emphasis">sulfur cycle</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_08_07_SCycle"/>). Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria as well as chemoautotrophic archaea and bacteria use hydrogen sulfide as an <term class="no-emphasis">electron donor</term>, oxidizing it first to elemental sulfur (S<sup>0</sup>), then to sulfate <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mtext>SO</m:mtext><m:mn>4</m:mn></m:msub></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mn>2</m:mn><m:mo>−</m:mo></m:mrow></m:msup></m:mrow><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> This leads to stratification of hydrogen sulfide in soil, with levels increasing at deeper, more anaerobic depths.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660277936">Many bacteria and plants can use sulfate as a sulfur source. Decomposition dead organisms by fungi and bacteria remove sulfur groups from amino acids, producing hydrogen sulfide, returning inorganic sulfur to the environment.</para>

Sulfate can be absorbed or converted to mineral sulfur. Bacterial reduction converts sulfate to reduced sulfur (H2S, HS). Oxidation converts reduced sulfur and elemental sulfur (SO0) to sulfate.">

<title>Other Biogeochemical Cycles</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662445119">Beyond their involvement in the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles, prokaryotes are involved in other biogeochemical cycles as well. Like the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles, several of these additional biogeochemical cycles, such as the iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and chromium (Cr) cycles, also involve redox chemistry, with prokaryotes playing roles in both oxidation and reduction. Several other elements undergo chemical cycles that do not involve redox chemistry. Examples of these are phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and silica (Si) cycles. The cycling of these elements is particularly important in oceans because large quantities of these elements are incorporated into the exoskeletons of marine organisms. These <term class="no-emphasis">biogeochemical cycle</term>s do not involve redox chemistry but instead involve fluctuations in the solubility of compounds containing calcium, phosphorous, and silica. The overgrowth of naturally occurring microbial communities is typically limited by the availability of nitrogen (as previously mentioned), phosphorus, and iron. Human activities introducing excessive amounts of iron, nitrogen, or phosphorus (typically from detergents) may lead to <term class="no-emphasis">eutrophication</term>.</para>

<title>Bioremediation</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660463521">Microbial <term>bioremediation</term> leverages microbial metabolism to remove <term>xenobiotic</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis> or other pollutants. Xenobiotics are compounds synthesized by humans and introduced into the environment in much higher concentrations than would naturally occur. Such environmental contamination may involve adhesives, dyes, flame retardants, lubricants, oil and petroleum products, organic solvents, pesticides, and products of the combustion of gasoline and oil. Many xenobiotics resist breakdown, and some accumulate in the food chain after being consumed or absorbed by fish and wildlife, which, in turn, may be eaten by humans. Of particular concern are contaminants like <term class="no-emphasis">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)</term>, a carcinogenic xenobiotic found in crude oil, and <term class="no-emphasis">trichloroethylene (TCE)</term>, a common groundwater contaminant.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662916110">Bioremediation processes can be categorized as in situ or ex situ. Bioremediation conducted at the site of contamination is called <term class="no-emphasis">in situ bioremediation</term> and does not involve movement of contaminated material. In contrast, <term class="no-emphasis">ex situ bioremediation</term> involves the removal of contaminated material from the original site so that it can be treated elsewhere, typically in a large, lined pit where conditions are optimized for degradation of the contaminant.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660268252">Some bioremediation processes rely on microorganisms that are indigenous to the contaminated site or material. Enhanced bioremediation techniques, which may be applied to either in situ or ex situ processing, involve the addition of nutrients and/or air to encourage the growth of pollution-degrading microbes; they may also involve the addition of non-native microbes known for their ability to degrade contaminants. For example, certain bacteria of the genera <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Rhodococcus</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Pseudomonas</emphasis></term> are known for their ability to degrade many environmental contaminants, including aromatic compounds like those found in oil, down to CO<sub>2</sub>. The genes encoding their degradatory enzymes are commonly found on plasmids. Others, like <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Alcanivorax borkumensis</emphasis></term>, produce surfactants that are useful in the solubilization of the hydrophobic molecules found in oil, making them more accessible to other microbes for degradation.</para>
