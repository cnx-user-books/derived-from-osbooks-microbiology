<para id="fs-id1167662440718">As explained in <link document="m58884">Overview of Specific Adaptive Immunity</link>, the antibodies involved in humoral immunity often bind pathogens and toxins before they can attach to and invade host cells. Thus, humoral immunity is primarily concerned with fighting pathogens in extracellular spaces. However, pathogens that have already gained entry to host cells are largely protected from the humoral antibody-mediated defenses. Cellular immunity, on the other hand, targets and eliminates <term class="no-emphasis">intracellular pathogens</term> through the actions of T lymphocytes, or T cells (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_18_03_Tcell"/>). T cells also play a more central role in orchestrating the overall adaptive immune response (humoral as well as cellular) along with the cellular defenses of innate immunity.</para>

<title>T Cell Production and Maturation</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662417831">T cells, like all other white blood cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity, are formed from multipotent <term class="no-emphasis">hematopoietic stem cells</term> (HSCs) in the bone marrow (see <link document="m58879" target-id="OSC_Microbio_17_05_Hematopo"/>). However, unlike the white blood cells of innate immunity, eventual T cells differentiate first into lymphoid stem cells that then become small, immature lymphocytes, sometimes called <term class="no-emphasis">lymphoblasts</term>. The first steps of differentiation occur in the red marrow of bones (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_18_01_marrow"/>), after which immature T lymphocytes enter the bloodstream and travel to the <term class="no-emphasis">thymus</term> for the final steps of maturation (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_18_01_thymus"/>). Once in the thymus, the immature T lymphocytes are referred to as <term class="no-emphasis">thymocytes</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662705980">The maturation of thymocytes within the thymus can be divided into three critical steps of positive and negative selection, collectively referred to as <term>thymic selection</term>. The first step of thymic selection occurs in the cortex of the thymus and involves the development of a functional <term class="no-emphasis">T-cell receptor (TCR)</term> that is required for activation by APCs. Thymocytes with defective TCRs are removed by negative selection through the induction of <term>apoptosis</term> (programmed controlled cell death). The second step of thymic selection also occurs in the cortex and involves the positive selection of thymocytes that will interact appropriately with MHC molecules. Thymocytes that can interact appropriately with MHC molecules receive a positive stimulation that moves them further through the process of maturation, whereas thymocytes that do not interact appropriately are not stimulated and are eliminated by <term class="no-emphasis">apoptosis</term>. The third and final step of thymic selection occurs in both the cortex and medulla and involves <term class="no-emphasis">negative selection</term> to remove <term class="no-emphasis">self-reacting thymocytes</term>, those that react to self-antigens, by apoptosis. This final step is sometimes referred to as <term>central tolerance</term> because it prevents self-reacting T cells from reaching the bloodstream and potentially causing <term class="no-emphasis">autoimmune disease</term>, which occurs when the immune system attacks healthy “self” cells.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662615231">Despite central tolerance, some self-reactive T cells generally escape the thymus and enter the peripheral bloodstream. Therefore, a second line of defense called <term>peripheral tolerance</term> is needed to protect against autoimmune disease. Peripheral tolerance involves mechanisms of <term>anergy</term> and inhibition of self-reactive T cells by <term>regulatory T cells</term>. Anergy refers to a state of nonresponsiveness to antigen stimulation. In the case of self-reactive T cells that escape the thymus, lack of an essential <term class="no-emphasis">co-stimulatory signal</term> required for activation causes anergy and prevents autoimmune activation. Regulatory T cells participate in peripheral tolerance by inhibiting the activation and function of self-reactive T cells and by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167658164388">It is not completely understood what events specifically direct maturation of thymocytes into regulatory T cells. Current theories suggest the critical events may occur during the third step of thymic selection, when most self-reactive T cells are eliminated. Regulatory T cells may receive a unique signal that is below the threshold required to target them for negative selection and apoptosis. Consequently, these cells continue to mature and then exit the thymus, armed to inhibit the activation of self-reactive T cells.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660340483">It has been estimated that the three steps of thymic selection eliminate 98% of thymocytes. The remaining 2% that exit the thymus migrate through the bloodstream and <term class="no-emphasis">lymphatic system</term> to sites of secondary lymphoid organs/tissues, such as the <term class="no-emphasis">lymph nodes</term>, <term class="no-emphasis">spleen</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis">tonsils</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_18_01_thymus"/>), where they await activation through the presentation of specific antigens by APCs. Until they are activated, they are known as <term>mature naïve T cells</term>.</para>

<title>Classes of T Cells</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662482791">T cells can be categorized into three distinct classes: <term class="no-emphasis">helper T cells</term>, regulatory T cells, and <term class="no-emphasis">cytotoxic T cells</term>. These classes are differentiated based on their expression of certain surface molecules, their mode of activation, and their functional roles in adaptive immunity (<link target-id="fs-id1167662906208"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662375370">All T cells produce <term>cluster of differentiation (CD) molecules</term>, cell surface glycoproteins that can be used to identify and distinguish between the various types of white blood cells. Although T cells can produce a variety of CD molecules, <term class="no-emphasis">CD4</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">CD8</term> are the two most important used for differentiation of the classes. Helper T cells and regulatory T cells are characterized by the expression of CD4 on their surface, whereas cytotoxic T cells are characterized by the expression of CD8.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660262018">Classes of T cells can also be distinguished by the specific MHC molecules and APCs with which they interact for activation. Helper T cells and regulatory T cells can only be activated by APCs presenting antigens associated with <term class="no-emphasis">MHC II</term>. In contrast, cytotoxic T cells recognize antigens presented in association with <term class="no-emphasis">MHC I</term>, either by APCs or by nucleated cells infected with an intracellular pathogen.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662732142">The different classes of T cells also play different functional roles in the immune system. <term>Helper T cells</term> serve as the central orchestrators that help activate and direct functions of humoral and cellular immunity. In addition, helper T cells enhance the pathogen-killing functions of <term class="no-emphasis">macrophages</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">NK cells</term> of innate immunity. In contrast, the primary role of regulatory T cells is to prevent undesirable and potentially damaging immune responses. Their role in <term class="no-emphasis">peripheral tolerance</term>, for example, protects against <term class="no-emphasis">autoimmune disorders</term>, as discussed earlier. Finally, <term>cytotoxic T cells</term> are the primary effector cells for cellular immunity. They recognize and target cells that have been infected by <term class="no-emphasis">intracellular pathogens</term>, destroying infected cells along with the pathogens inside.</para>

<title>T-Cell Receptors</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662393494">For both helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, activation is a complex process that requires the interactions of multiple molecules and exposure to cytokines. The <term>T-cell receptor (TCR)</term> is involved in the first step of pathogen epitope recognition during the activation process.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662904880">The TCR comes from the same receptor family as the antibodies IgD and IgM, the antigen receptors on the B cell membrane surface, and thus shares common structural elements. Similar to antibodies, the TCR has a <term class="no-emphasis">variable region</term> and a <term class="no-emphasis">constant region</term>, and the variable region provides the antigen-binding site (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_18_03_TCR"/>). However, the structure of TCR is smaller and less complex than the immunoglobulin molecules (<link document="m58884" target-id="OSC_Microbio_18_04_ABstruct"/>). Whereas immunoglobulins have four peptide chains and Y-shaped structures, the TCR consists of just two peptide chains (α and β chains), both of which span the cytoplasmic membrane of the T cell.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662418771">TCRs are epitope-specific, and it has been estimated that 25 million T cells with unique epitope-binding TCRs are required to protect an individual against a wide range of microbial pathogens. Because the human genome only contains about 25,000 genes, we know that each specific TCR cannot be encoded by its own set of genes. This raises the question of how such a vast population of T cells with millions of specific TCRs can be achieved. The answer is a process called <term class="no-emphasis">genetic rearrangement</term>, which occurs in the thymus during the first step of <term class="no-emphasis">thymic selection</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660267713">The genes that code for the variable regions of the TCR are divided into distinct gene segments called <term class="no-emphasis">variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments</term>. The genes segments associated with the α chain of the TCR consist 70 or more different V<sub>α</sub> segments and 61 different J<sub>α</sub> segments. The gene segments associated with the β chain of the TCR consist of 52 different V<sub>β</sub> segments, two different D<sub>β</sub> segments, and 13 different J<sub>β</sub> segments. During the development of the functional TCR in the thymus, genetic rearrangement in a T cell brings together one V<sub>α</sub> segment and one J<sub>α</sub> segment to code for the variable region of the α chain. Similarly, genetic rearrangement brings one of the V<sub>β</sub> segments together with one of the D<sub>β</sub> segments and one of thetJ<sub>β</sub> segments to code for the variable region of the β chain. All the possible combinations of rearrangements between different segments of V, D, and J provide the genetic diversity required to produce millions of TCRs with unique epitope-specific variable regions.</para>

The second step involves the interaction of <term class="no-emphasis">CD4</term> on the helper T cell with a region of the MHC II molecule separate from the antigen-binding cleft.

<title>Activation and Differentiation of Cytotoxic T Cells</title>
<para id="fs-id1167657961826">Cytotoxic T cells (also referred to as <term class="no-emphasis">cytotoxic T lymphocytes</term>, or CTLs) are activated by APCs in a three-step process similar to that of helper T cells. The key difference is that the <term class="no-emphasis">activation of cytotoxic T cells</term> involves recognition of an antigen presented with MHC I (as opposed to MHC II) and interaction of CD8 (as opposed to CD4) with the receptor complex. After the successful co-recognition of foreign epitope and self-antigen, the production of <term class="no-emphasis">cytokines</term> by the APC and the cytotoxic T cell activate <term class="no-emphasis">clonal proliferation</term> and differentiation. Activated cytotoxic T cells can differentiate into effector cytotoxic T cells that target pathogens for destruction or <term class="no-emphasis">memory cells</term> that are ready to respond to subsequent exposures.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662511460">As noted, proliferation and differentiation of cytotoxic T cells is also stimulated by cytokines secreted from T<sub>H</sub>1 cells activated by the same foreign epitope.

<title>Superantigens and Unregulated Activation of T Cells</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660216351">When T cell activation is controlled and regulated, the result is a protective response that is effective in combating infections. However, if T cell activation is unregulated and excessive, the result can be life-threatening. Certain bacterial and viral pathogens produce toxins known as <term class="no-emphasis">superantigens</term> (see <link document="m58868">Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens</link>) that can trigger such an unregulated response. Known bacterial superantigens include <term class="no-emphasis">toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)</term>, <term class="no-emphasis">staphylococcal enterotoxins</term>, <term class="no-emphasis">streptococcal pyrogenic toxins</term>, <term class="no-emphasis">streptococcal superantigen</term>, and the <term class="no-emphasis">streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin</term>. Viruses known to produce superantigens include <term class="no-emphasis">Epstein-Barr virus</term> (human herpesvirus 4), <term class="no-emphasis">cytomegalovirus</term> (human herpesvirus 5), and others.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662506529">The mechanism of T cell activation by superantigens involves their simultaneous binding to <term class="no-emphasis">MHC II</term> molecules of APCs and the variable region of the <term class="no-emphasis">TCR</term> β chain. This binding occurs outside of the antigen-binding cleft of MHC II, so the superantigen will bridge together and activate MHC II and TCR without specific foreign epitope recognition (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_18_03_SuperAntig"/>). The result is an excessive, uncontrolled release of cytokines, often called a <term>cytokine storm</term>, which stimulates an excessive inflammatory response. This can lead to a dangerous decrease in blood pressure, shock, multi-organ failure, and potentially, death.</para>

<caption>(a) The macrophage in this figure is presenting a foreign epitope that does not match the TCR of the T cell. Because the T cell does not recognize the epitope, it is not activated. (b) The macrophage in this figure is presenting a superantigen that is not recognized by the TCR of the T cell, yet the superantigen still is able to bridge and bind the MHC II and TCR molecules. This nonspecific, uncontrolled activation of the T cell results in an excessive release of cytokines that activate other T cells and cause excessive inflammation.

<para id="fs-id1167662644579">Melissa, an otherwise healthy 22-year-old woman, is brought to the emergency room by her concerned boyfriend. She complains of a sudden onset of high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle aches. In her initial interview, she tells the attending physician that she is on hormonal birth control and also is two days into the menstruation portion of her cycle. She is on no other medications and is not abusing any drugs or alcohol. She is not a smoker. She is not diabetic and does not currently have an infection of any kind to her knowledge.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660132476">While waiting in the emergency room, Melissa’s blood pressure begins to drop dramatically and her mental state deteriorates to general confusion. The physician believes she is likely suffering from <term class="no-emphasis">toxic shock syndrome (TSS)</term>. TSS is caused by the toxin TSST-1, a superantigen associated with <emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>, and improper tampon use is a common cause of infections leading to TSS. The superantigen inappropriately stimulates widespread T cell activation and excessive cytokine release, resulting in a massive and systemic inflammatory response that can be fatal.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662870972">Vaginal or cervical swabs may be taken to confirm the presence of the microbe, but these tests are not critical to perform based on Melissa’s symptoms and medical history. The physician prescribes rehydration, supportive therapy, and antibiotics to stem the bacterial infection. She also prescribes drugs to increase Melissa’s blood pressure. Melissa spends three days in the hospital undergoing treatment; in addition, her kidney function is monitored because of the high risk of kidney failure associated with TSS. After 72 hours, Melissa is well enough to be discharged to continue her recovery at home.</para>

In addition, little Olivia is reluctant to turn her head and appears to be experiencing severe neck pain. The physician orders a complete blood count, blood culture, and lumbar puncture. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained appears cloudy and is further evaluated by Gram stain assessment and culturing for potential bacterial pathogens. The complete blood count indicates elevated numbers of white blood cells in Olivia’s bloodstream. The white blood cell increases are recorded at 28.5 K/µL (normal range: 6.0–17.5 K/µL). The neutrophil percentage was recorded as 60% (normal range: 23–45%). Glucose levels in the CSF were registered at 30 mg/100 mL (normal range: 50–80 mg/100 mL). The WBC count in the CSF was 1,163/mm<sup>3</sup> (normal range: 5–20/mm<sup>3</sup>).</para>

<item>Immature T lymphocytes are produced in the red bone marrow and travel to the thymus for maturation.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Thymic selection</emphasis> is a three-step process of negative and positive selection that determines which T cells will mature and exit the thymus into the peripheral bloodstream.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Central tolerance</emphasis> involves negative selection of self-reactive T cells in the thymus, and <emphasis effect="bold">peripheral tolerance</emphasis> involves <emphasis effect="bold">anergy</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">regulatory T cells</emphasis> that prevent self-reactive immune responses and autoimmunity.</item>
<item>The <emphasis effect="bold">TCR</emphasis> is similar in structure to immunoglobulins, but less complex. Millions of unique epitope-binding TCRs are encoded through a process of genetic rearrangement of V, D, and J gene segments.</item>
<item>T cells can be divided into three classes—<emphasis effect="bold">helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells,</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">regulatory T cells—</emphasis>based on their expression of CD4 or CD8, the MHC molecules with which they interact for activation, and their respective functions.</item>
<item>Activated helper T cells differentiate into <emphasis effect="bold">T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2, T<sub>H</sub>17</emphasis>, or <emphasis effect="bold">memory T cell subtypes</emphasis>. Differentiation is directed by the specific cytokines to which they are exposed. T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2, and T<sub>H</sub>17 perform different functions related to stimulation of adaptive and innate immune defenses. Memory T cells are long-lived cells that can respond quickly to secondary exposures.</item>
<item>Once activated, cytotoxic T cells target and kill cells infected with intracellular pathogens. Killing requires recognition of specific pathogen epitopes presented on the cell surface using MHC I molecules. Killing is mediated by <emphasis effect="bold">perforin</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">granzymes</emphasis> that induce apoptosis.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Superantigens</emphasis> are bacterial or viral proteins that cause a nonspecific activation of helper T cells, leading to an excessive release of cytokines (<emphasis effect="bold">cytokine storm</emphasis>) and a systemic, potentially fatal inflammatory response.</item>
