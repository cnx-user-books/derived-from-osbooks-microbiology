<para id="fs-id1167663990318">Many fungal infections of the skin involve fungi that are found in the normal skin microbiota. Some of these fungi can cause infection when they gain entry through a wound; others mainly cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. Other fungal pathogens primarily cause infection in unusually moist environments that promote fungal growth; for example, sweaty shoes, communal showers, and locker rooms provide excellent breeding grounds that promote the growth and transmission of fungal pathogens.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663570325">Fungal infections, also called <term class="no-emphasis">mycoses</term>, can be divided into classes based on their invasiveness. Mycoses that cause superficial infections of the epidermis, hair, and nails, are called <term>cutaneous mycoses</term>. Mycoses that penetrate the epidermis and the dermis to infect deeper tissues are called <term>subcutaneous mycoses</term>. Mycoses that spread throughout the body are called <term>systemic mycoses</term>.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167663968102">Dermatophytes are commonly found in the environment and in soils and are frequently transferred to the skin via contact with other humans and animals. Fungal spores can also spread on hair. Many dermatophytes grow well in moist, dark environments. For example, <term>tinea pedis</term> (athlete’s foot) commonly spreads in public showers, and the causative fungi grow well in the dark, moist confines of sweaty shoes and socks. Likewise, <term>tinea cruris</term> (jock itch) often spreads in communal living environments and thrives in warm, moist undergarments.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663644026">Tineas on the body (<term>tinea corporis</term>) often produce lesions that grow radially and heal towards the center. This causes the formation of a red ring, leading to the misleading name of ringworm recall the Clinical Focus case in <link target-id="fs-id1172101975536" document="m58802">The Eukaryotes of Microbiology</link>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663589443">Several approaches may be used to diagnose tineas. A <term class="no-emphasis">Wood’s lamp</term> (also called a black lamp) with a wavelength of 365 nm is often used. When directed on a tinea, the ultraviolet light emitted from the Wood’s lamp causes the fungal elements (spores and hyphae) to fluoresce. Direct microscopic evaluation of specimens from skin scrapings, hair, or nails can also be used to detect fungi. Generally, these specimens are prepared in a wet mount using a potassium hydroxide solution (10%–20% aqueous KOH), which dissolves the keratin in hair, nails, and skin cells to allow for visualization of the hyphae and fungal spores. The specimens may be grown on Sabouraud dextrose CC (chloramphenicol/cyclohexamide), a selective agar that supports dermatophyte growth while inhibiting the growth of bacteria and saprophytic fungi (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_21_04_dermatophy"/>). Macroscopic colony morphology is often used to initially identify the genus of the dermatophyte; identification can be further confirmed by visualizing the microscopic morphology using either a slide culture or a sticky tape prep stained with lactophenol cotton blue.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663741368">Various antifungal treatments can be effective against tineas. Allylamine ointments that include <term class="no-emphasis">terbinafine</term> are commonly used; <term class="no-emphasis">miconazole</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">clotrimazole</term> are also available for topical treatment, and <term class="no-emphasis">griseofulvin</term> is used orally.</para>

It is usually reported in patients who have had an injury while working in an agricultural or outdoor environment. However, opportunistic infections can also occur in health-care settings, often at the site of intravenous catheters, venipuncture wounds, or in association with burns, surgical wounds, or occlusive dressing. After candidiasis, aspergillosis is the second most common hospital-acquired fungal infection and often occurs in immunocompromised patients, who are more vulnerable to opportunistic infections.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663732833">Cutaneous aspergillosis is diagnosed using patient history, culturing, histopathology using a skin biopsy.

<para id="fs-id1167663929443">Candidiasis of the skin and nails is diagnosed through clinical observation and through culture, Gram stain, and KOH wet mounts.
