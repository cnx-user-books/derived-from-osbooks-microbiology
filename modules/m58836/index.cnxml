In <link document="m58818">Microbial Metabolism</link>, we discussed the microbial catabolism of three classes of macromolecules: proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In this chapter, we will discuss the genetic role of a fourth class of molecules: nucleic acids. Like other macromolecules, <term>nucleic acid</term>s are composed of monomers, called <term>nucleotide</term>s, which are polymerized to form large strands. Each nucleic acid strand contains certain nucleotides that appear in a certain order within the strand, called its <term>base sequence</term>. The base sequence of <term>deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</term> is responsible for carrying and retaining the hereditary information in a cell. In <link document="m58839">Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics</link>, we will discuss in detail the ways in which DNA uses its own base sequence to direct its own synthesis, as well as the synthesis of <term class="no-emphasis">RNA</term> and proteins, which, in turn, gives rise to products with diverse structure and function. In this section, we will discuss the basic structure and function of DNA.</para>

<title>DNA Nucleotides</title>
<para id="fs-id1172099872667">The building blocks of nucleic acids are nucleotides. Nucleotides that compose DNA are called <term>deoxyribonucleotides</term>. The three components of a deoxyribonucleotide are a five-carbon sugar called <term class="no-emphasis">deoxyribose</term>, a phosphate group, and a <term>nitrogenous base</term>, a nitrogen-containing ring structure that is responsible for <term class="no-emphasis">complementary base pairing</term> between nucleic acid strands (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_10_02_Nucleotide"/>). The carbon atoms of the five-carbon deoxyribose are numbered 1ʹ, 2ʹ, 3ʹ, 4ʹ, and 5ʹ (1ʹ is read as “one prime”).

Phosphodiester bonding between nucleotides forms the <term>sugar-phosphate backbone</term>, the alternating sugar-phosphate structure composing the framework of a nucleic acid strand (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_10_02_NAcidStrand"/>). During the polymerization process, deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTP) are used. To construct the sugar-phosphate backbone, the two terminal phosphates are released from the dNTP as a pyrophosphate. The resulting strand of nucleic acid has a free phosphate group at the 5ʹ carbon end and a free hydroxyl group at the 3ʹ carbon end. The two unused phosphate groups from the nucleotide triphosphate are released as pyrophosphate during phosphodiester bond formation. Pyrophosphate is subsequently hydrolyzed, releasing the energy used to drive nucleotide polymerization.</para>

<title>Discovering the Double Helix</title>
<para id="fs-id1172099533999">By the early 1950s, considerable evidence had accumulated indicating that DNA was the genetic material of cells, and now the race was on to discover its three-dimensional structure. Around this time, Austrian biochemist Erwin <term class="no-emphasis">Chargaff</term><footnote id="fs-id1172099750136">N. Kresge et al. “Chargaff's Rules: The Work of Erwin Chargaff.” <emphasis effect="italics">Journal of Biological Chemistry</emphasis> 280 (2005):e21.</footnote> (1905–2002) examined the content of <term class="no-emphasis">DNA</term> in different species and discovered that adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine were not found in equal quantities, and that it varied from species to species, but not between individuals of the same species. He found that the amount of adenine was very close to equaling the amount of thymine, and the amount of cytosine was very close to equaling the amount of guanine, or A = T and G = C. These relationships are also known as <term class="no-emphasis">Chargaff’s rules</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172097453610">Other scientists were also actively exploring this field during the mid-20th century.

<para id="fs-id1172101888932"><term class="no-emphasis">Watson and Crick</term> proposed that <term class="no-emphasis">DNA</term> is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed helix. The two DNA strands are <term>antiparallel</term>, such that the 3ʹ end of one strand faces the 5ʹ end of the other (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_10_02_DoubHelix"/>). The 3ʹ end of each strand has a free hydroxyl group, while the 5ʹ end of each strand has a free phosphate group. The sugar and phosphate of the polymerized nucleotides form the backbone of the structure, whereas the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside. These nitrogenous bases on the interior of the molecule interact with each other, base pairing.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172097181884">Analysis of the diffraction patterns of DNA has determined that there are approximately 10 bases per turn in DNA. The asymmetrical spacing of the sugar-phosphate backbones generates major grooves (where the backbone is far apart) and minor grooves (where the backbone is close together) (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_10_02_DoubHelix"/>). These grooves are locations where proteins can bind to DNA. The binding of these proteins can alter the structure of DNA, regulate <term class="no-emphasis">replication</term>, or regulate <term class="no-emphasis">transcription</term> of DNA into RNA.</para>

The ability to artificially manipulate DNA in this way is the basis for several important techniques in biotechnology (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_10_02_Denatured"/>).

Possibilities include bacterial infection (e.g., <term class="no-emphasis">enterotoxigenic <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis></term>, <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Vibrio cholerae</emphasis></term>, <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Campylobacter jejuni</emphasis></term>, <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis></term>), viral infection (rotavirus or norovirus), or protozoan infection (<term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Giardia lamblia</emphasis></term>, <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Cryptosporidium parvum</emphasis></term>, or <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Entamoeba histolytica</emphasis></term>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099409047">His physician orders a stool sample to identify possible causative agents (e.g., bacteria, cysts) and to look for the presence of blood because certain types of infectious agents (like <emphasis effect="italics">C. jejuni</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">E. histolytica</emphasis>) are associated with the production of bloody stools.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172097392072">Alex’s stool sample showed neither blood nor cysts. Following analysis of his stool sample and based upon his recent travel history, the hospital physician suspected that Alex was suffering from traveler’s diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> (<term class="no-emphasis">ETEC</term>), the causative agent of most traveler’s diarrhea. To verify the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, Alex’s physician ordered a diagnostic lab test of his stool sample to look for DNA sequences encoding specific virulence factors of ETEC. The physician instructed Alex to drink lots of fluids to replace what he was losing and discharged him from the hospital.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099605962">ETEC produces several plasmid-encoded virulence factors that make it pathogenic compared with typical <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>. These include the secreted toxins <term class="no-emphasis">heat-labile enterotoxin (LT)</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">heat-stabile enterotoxin (ST)</term>, as well as <term class="no-emphasis">colonization factor (CF)</term>. Both LT and ST cause the excretion of chloride ions from intestinal cells to the intestinal lumen, causing a consequent loss of water from intestinal cells, resulting in diarrhea. CF encodes a bacterial protein that aids in allowing the bacterium to adhere to the lining of the small intestine.</para>

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<list id="fs-id1172099880167" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Nucleic acids</emphasis> are composed of <emphasis effect="bold">nucleotides</emphasis>, each of which contains a pentose sugar, a phosphate group, and a <emphasis effect="bold">nitrogenous base</emphasis>. <emphasis effect="bold">Deoxyribonucleotides</emphasis> within DNA contain <emphasis effect="bold">deoxyribose</emphasis> as the pentose sugar.</item>
<item>DNA contains the <emphasis effect="bold">pyrimidines cytosine</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">thymine</emphasis>, and the <emphasis effect="bold">purines</emphasis> <emphasis effect="bold">adenine</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">guanine</emphasis>.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Nucleotides</emphasis> are linked together by phosphodiester bonds between the 5ʹ phosphate group of one nucleotide and the 3ʹ hydroxyl group of another. A <emphasis effect="bold">nucleic acid strand</emphasis> has a free phosphate group at the 5ʹ end and a free hydroxyl group at the 3ʹ end.</item>
<item>Chargaff discovered that the amount of <emphasis effect="bold">adenine</emphasis> is approximately equal to the amount of <emphasis effect="bold">thymine</emphasis> in DNA, and that the amount of the <emphasis effect="bold">guanine</emphasis> is approximately equal to <emphasis effect="bold">cytosine</emphasis>. These relationships were later determined to be due to complementary base pairing.</item>
<item>Watson and Crick, building on the work of Chargaff, Franklin and Gosling, and Wilkins, proposed the double helix model and base pairing for DNA structure.</item>
<item>DNA is composed of two complementary strands oriented <emphasis effect="bold">antiparallel</emphasis> to each other with the <emphasis effect="bold">phosphodiester backbones</emphasis> on the exterior of the molecule. The nitrogenous bases of each strand face each other and complementary bases hydrogen bond to each other, stabilizing the double helix.</item>
<item>Heat or chemicals can break the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, denaturing DNA. Cooling or removing chemicals can lead to renaturation or reannealing of DNA by allowing hydrogen bonds to reform between complementary bases.</item>
<item>DNA stores the instructions needed to build and control the cell. This information is transmitted from parent to offspring through <emphasis effect="bold">vertical gene transfer</emphasis>.</item>
