<para id="fs-id1167660395679">We have just discussed two pathways in glucose catabolism—glycolysis and the Krebs cycle—that generate ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. Most ATP, however, is generated during a separate process called <term>oxidative phosphorylation</term>, which occurs during cellular respiration. Cellular respiration begins when electrons are transferred from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>—made in glycolysis, the transition reaction, and the Krebs cycle—through a series of chemical reactions to a final inorganic electron acceptor (either oxygen in aerobic respiration or non-oxygen inorganic molecules in anaerobic respiration). These electron transfers take place on the inner part of the cell membrane of prokaryotic cells or in specialized protein complexes in the inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. The energy of the electrons is harvested to generate an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is used to make ATP by oxidative phosphorylation.</para>

<title>Electron Transport System</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660271234">The <term>electron transport system (ETS)</term> is the last component involved in the process of cellular respiration; it comprises a series of membrane-associated protein complexes and associated mobile accessory electron carriers (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_08_03_Chemiosmos"/>). Electron transport is a series of chemical reactions that resembles a bucket brigade in that electrons from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are passed rapidly from one ETS electron carrier to the next. These carriers can pass electrons along in the ETS because of their <term>redox potential</term>. For a protein or chemical to accept electrons, it must have a more positive redox potential than the electron donor. Therefore, electrons move from electron carriers with more negative redox potential to those with more positive redox potential. The four major classes of electron carriers involved in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic electron transport systems are the <term class="no-emphasis">cytochrome</term>s, <term class="no-emphasis">flavoprotein</term>s, <term class="no-emphasis">iron-sulfur protein</term>s, and the <term class="no-emphasis">quinone</term>s.</para><para id="fs-id1167660307758">In <term>aerobic respiration</term>, the final electron acceptor (i.e., the one having the most positive redox potential) at the end of the ETS is an oxygen molecule (O<sub>2</sub>) that becomes reduced to water (H<sub>2</sub>O) by the final ETS carrier. This electron carrier, <term>cytochrome oxidase</term>, differs between bacterial types and can be used to differentiate closely related bacteria for diagnoses. For example, the gram-negative opportunist <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis></term> and the gram-negative cholera-causing <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Vibrio cholerae</emphasis></term> use cytochrome c oxidase, which can be detected by the oxidase test, whereas other gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae, like <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>, are negative for this test because they produce different cytochrome oxidase types.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660572610">There are many circumstances under which aerobic respiration is not possible, including any one or more of the following:</para>
<list id="fs-id1167662758891" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>The cell lacks genes encoding an appropriate cytochrome oxidase for transferring electrons to oxygen at the end of the electron transport system.</item>

<para id="fs-id1167662461124">One possible alternative to aerobic respiration is <term>anaerobic respiration</term>, using an inorganic molecule other than oxygen as a final electron acceptor.

<para id="fs-id1167660640372">Microbes using anaerobic respiration commonly have an intact Krebs cycle, so these organisms can access the energy of the NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> molecules formed. However, anaerobic respirers use altered ETS carriers encoded by their genomes, including distinct complexes for electron transfer to their final electron acceptors. Smaller electrochemical gradients are generated from these electron transfer systems, so less ATP is formed through anaerobic respiration.</para>

<title>Chemiosmosis, Proton Motive Force, and Oxidative Phosphorylation</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662369719">In each transfer of an electron through the ETS, the electron loses energy, but with some transfers, the energy is stored as potential energy by using it to pump hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) across a membrane. In prokaryotic cells, H<sup>+</sup> is pumped to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane (called the periplasmic space in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria), and in eukaryotic cells, they are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space. There is an uneven distribution of H<sup>+</sup> across the membrane that establishes an electrochemical gradient because H<sup>+</sup> ions are positively charged (electrical) and there is a higher concentration (chemical) on one side of the membrane. This electrochemical gradient formed by the accumulation of H<sup>+</sup> (also known as a proton) on one side of the membrane compared with the other is referred to as the <term>proton motive force</term> (PMF). Because the ions involved are H<sup>+</sup>, a pH gradient is also established, with the side of the membrane having the higher concentration of H<sup>+</sup> being more acidic. Beyond the use of the PMF to make ATP, as discussed in this chapter, the PMF can also be used to drive other energetically unfavorable processes, including nutrient transport and flagella rotation for motility.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662553220">The potential energy of this electrochemical gradient generated by the ETS causes the H<sup>+</sup> to diffuse across a membrane (the plasma membrane in prokaryotic cells and the inner membrane in mitochondria in eukaryotic cells). This flow of hydrogen ions across the membrane, called <term>chemiosmosis</term>, must occur through a channel in the membrane via a membrane-bound enzyme complex called <term>ATP synthase</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_08_03_Chemiosmos"/>). The tendency for movement in this way is much like water accumulated on one side of a dam, moving through the dam when opened. ATP synthase (like a combination of the intake and generator of a hydroelectric dam) is a complex protein that acts as a tiny generator, turning by the force of the H<sup>+</sup> diffusing through the enzyme, down their electrochemical gradient from where there are many mutually repelling H<sup>+</sup> to where there are fewer H<sup>+</sup>. In prokaryotic cells, H<sup>+</sup> flows from the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, whereas in eukaryotic mitochondria, H<sup>+</sup> flows from the intermembrane space to the mitochondrial matrix. The turning of the parts of this molecular machine regenerates ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) by <term class="no-emphasis">oxidative phosphorylation</term>, a second mechanism for making ATP that harvests the potential energy stored within an electrochemical gradient.</para>

<caption>The bacterial electron transport chain is a series of protein complexes, electron carriers, and ion pumps that is used to pump H<sup>+</sup> out of the bacterial cytoplasm into the extracellular space. H<sup>+</sup> flows back down the electrochemical gradient into the bacterial cytoplasm through ATP synthase, providing the energy for ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation.(credit: modification of work by Klaus Hoffmeier)</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1167660619383">The number of ATP molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies. For example, the number of hydrogen ions that the electron transport system complexes can pump through the membrane varies between different species of organisms. In aerobic respiration in mitochondria, the passage of electrons from one molecule of NADH generates enough proton motive force to make three ATP molecules by oxidative phosphorylation, whereas the passage of electrons from one molecule of FADH<sub>2</sub> generates enough proton motive force to make only two ATP molecules. Thus, the 10 NADH molecules made per glucose during glycolysis, the transition reaction, and the Krebs cycle carry enough energy to make 30 ATP molecules, whereas the two FADH<sub>2</sub> molecules made per glucose during these processes provide enough energy to make four ATP molecules. Overall, the theoretical maximum yield of ATP made during the complete aerobic respiration of glucose is 38 molecules, with four being made by substrate-level phosphorylation and 34 being made by oxidative phosphorylation (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_08_03_ATPYield"/>). In reality, the total ATP yield is usually less, ranging from one to 34 ATP molecules, depending on whether the cell is using aerobic respiration or anaerobic respiration; in eukaryotic cells, some energy is expended to transport intermediates from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria, affecting ATP yield.</para>
