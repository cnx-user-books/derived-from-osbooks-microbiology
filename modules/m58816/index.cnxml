<para id="fs-id1167663931282">At the beginning of this chapter, a famous experiment was described in which scientists synthesized <term class="no-emphasis">amino acid</term>s under conditions simulating those present on earth long before the evolution of life as we know it. These compounds are capable of bonding together in essentially any number, yielding molecules of essentially any size that possess a wide array of physical and chemical properties and perform numerous functions vital to all organisms. The molecules derived from amino acids can function as structural components of cells and subcellular entities, as sources of nutrients, as atom- and energy-storage reservoirs, and as functional species such as hormones, enzymes, receptors, and transport molecules.</para>

<title>Amino Acids and Peptide Bonds</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663585928">An <term>amino acid</term> is an organic molecule in which a hydrogen atom, a <term class="no-emphasis">carboxyl group</term> (–COOH), and an amino group (–NH<sub>2</sub>) are all bonded to the same carbon atom, the so-called <term class="no-emphasis">α carbon</term>. The fourth group bonded to the α carbon varies among the different amino acids and is called a <term class="no-emphasis">residue</term> or a <term>side chain</term>, represented in structural formulas by the letter <emphasis effect="italics">R</emphasis>. A residue is a monomer that results when two or more amino acids combine and remove water molecules. The primary structure of a protein, a peptide chain, is made of amino acid residues. The unique characteristics of the functional groups and <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">R</emphasis> group</term>s allow these components of the amino acids to form hydrogen, ionic, and disulfide bonds, along with polar/nonpolar interactions needed to form secondary, tertiary, and quaternary protein structures. These groups are composed primarily of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, in the form of hydrocarbons, acids, amides, alcohols, and amines. A few examples illustrating these possibilities are provided in <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_07_04_aminoacids"/>.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167663615826">Amino acids may chemically bond together by reaction of the <term class="no-emphasis">carboxylic acid</term> group of one molecule with the <term class="no-emphasis">amine group</term> of another. This reaction forms a <term>peptide bond</term> and a water molecule and is another example of <term class="no-emphasis">dehydration synthesis</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_07_04_peptide"/>). Molecules formed by chemically linking relatively modest numbers of <term class="no-emphasis">amino acid</term>s (approximately 50 or fewer) are called <term class="no-emphasis">peptide</term>s, and prefixes are often used to specify these numbers: <term class="no-emphasis">dipeptide</term>s (two amino acids), <term class="no-emphasis">tripeptide</term>s (three amino acids), and so forth. More generally, the approximate number of amino acids is designated: <term>oligopeptide</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis> are formed by joining up to approximately 20 amino acids, whereas <term>polypeptide</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis> are synthesized from up to approximately 50 amino acids.

<title>Protein Structure</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663524429">The size (length) and specific amino acid sequence of a protein are major determinants of its shape, and the shape of a protein is critical to its function. For example, in the process of biological <term class="no-emphasis">nitrogen fixation</term> (see <link document="m58825">Biogeochemical Cycles</link>), soil microorganisms collectively known as <term class="no-emphasis">rhizobia</term> symbiotically interact with roots of legume plants such as soybeans, peanuts, or beans to form a novel structure called a nodule on the plant roots. The plant then produces a carrier protein called leghemoglobin, a protein that carries nitrogen or oxygen. Leghemoglobin binds with a very high affinity to its substrate oxygen at a specific region of the protein where the shape and amino acid sequence are appropriate (the <term class="no-emphasis">active site</term>). If the shape or chemical environment of the active site is altered, even slightly, the substrate may not be able to bind as strongly, or it may not bind at all. Thus, for the protein to be fully active, it must have the appropriate shape for its function.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663633340">Protein structure is categorized in terms of four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The <term>primary structure</term> is simply the sequence of <term class="no-emphasis">amino acid</term>s that make up the <term class="no-emphasis">polypeptide chain</term>. <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_07_04_primary"/> depicts the primary structure of a protein.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663488147">The chain of amino acids that defines a protein’s primary structure is not rigid, but instead is flexible because of the nature of the bonds that hold the amino acids together. When the chain is sufficiently long, hydrogen bonding may occur between amine and carbonyl functional groups within the peptide backbone (excluding the <emphasis effect="italics">R</emphasis> side group), resulting in localized folding of the polypeptide chain into helices and sheets. These shapes constitute a protein’s <term>secondary structure</term>. The most common secondary structures are the α-helix and β-pleated sheet. In the <term>α-helix</term> structure, the helix is held by hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atom in a <term class="no-emphasis">carbonyl group</term> of one amino acid and the hydrogen atom of the amino group that is just four amino acid units farther along the chain. In the <term>β-pleated sheet</term>, the pleats are formed by similar <term class="no-emphasis">hydrogen bonds</term> between continuous sequences of carbonyl and <term class="no-emphasis">amino groups</term> that are further separated on the backbone of the polypeptide chain (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_07_04_secondary"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663810652">The next level of protein organization is the <term>tertiary structure</term>, which is the large-scale three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain. Tertiary structure is determined by interactions between amino acid residues that are far apart in the chain. A variety of interactions give rise to protein tertiary structure, such as <term>disulfide bridge</term>s, which are bonds between the sulfhydryl (–SH) functional groups on amino acid side groups; hydrogen bonds; ionic bonds; and hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar side chains. All these interactions, weak and strong, combine to determine the final three-dimensional shape of the protein and its function (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_07_04_tertiary"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663544563">The process by which a polypeptide chain assumes a large-scale, three-dimensional shape is called <term class="no-emphasis">protein folding</term>. Folded proteins that are fully functional in their normal biological role are said to possess a <term>native structure</term>. When a protein loses its three-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional. These <term class="no-emphasis">unfolded proteins</term> are <term>denatured</term>. Denaturation implies the loss of the <term class="no-emphasis">secondary structure</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">tertiary structure</term> (and, if present, the quaternary structure) without the loss of the primary structure.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663980379">Some proteins are assemblies of several separate <term class="no-emphasis">polypeptide</term>s, also known as <term class="no-emphasis">protein subunit</term>s. These proteins function adequately only when all subunits are present and appropriately configured. The interactions that hold these subunits together constitute the <term>quaternary structure</term> of the protein. The overall quaternary structure is stabilized by relatively weak interactions. Hemoglobin, for example, has a quaternary structure of four globular protein subunits: two α and two β polypeptides, each one containing an iron-based heme (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_07_04_hemoglobin"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663925053">Another important class of proteins is the <term>conjugated proteins</term> that have a nonprotein portion. If the conjugated protein has a carbohydrate attached, it is called a <term>glycoprotein</term>. If it has a lipid attached, it is called a <term>lipoprotein</term>. These proteins are important components of membranes. <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_07_04_proteinstr"/> summarizes the four levels of protein structure.</para>

<title>Primary Structure, Dysfunctional Proteins, and Cystic Fibrosis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663639357">Proteins associated with biological membranes are classified as extrinsic or intrinsic. Extrinsic proteins, also called peripheral proteins, are loosely associated with one side of the membrane. Intrinsic proteins, or integral proteins, are embedded in the membrane and often function as part of transport systems as transmembrane proteins. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a human genetic disorder caused by a change in the transmembrane protein. It affects mostly the lungs but may also affect the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestine. CF is caused by a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine in a <term class="no-emphasis">cystic fibrosis</term> transmembrane protein (CFTR). The loss of one amino acid changes the primary structure of a protein that normally helps transport salt and water in and out of cells (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_07_04_CFTRprot"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663916315">The change in the primary structure prevents the protein from functioning properly, which causes the body to produce unusually thick mucus that clogs the lungs and leads to the accumulation of sticky mucus.
